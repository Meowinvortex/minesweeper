<h1>C++ Minesweeper</h1>

<p>This is my first big project using c++, many libraries were used but the main ones being SFML and TGUI.
The goal with this project was to learn how to use SFML and I'd say it went quite well :D</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>. No part of this code was planned and was improvised<br>
   . Spagetti code<br>
   . Probably can be made more efficiently<br>
   . Works tho, as far as i can tell there are no bug</p>
